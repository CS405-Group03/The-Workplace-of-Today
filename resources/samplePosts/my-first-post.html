    The COVID-19 pandemic taught and realized us how crucial the internet and digital networks and platforms on our daily lives but also critical to economic activity (Wheeler, 2020). And yet thereâ€™s a problem, the  traditional appointment booking where a walk-in patient have to visit the clinic without any knowledge of availability of doctors, have to sit in a queue and wait for the turn (Sminq, 2019), which is known inconvenient, have to provide that day alone along with the busy schedules just for check-ups and spend time for long queues which is not applicable in quarantine as forbid clinics to build a flock of people inside the facility.
